Problem: duplicate loading of functions of controller and prev alives forever.

Step2
add a $scope.$on('$destroy', function(){
//release your scope and listeners.
});

Problem: duplication loading still exists, but prev destorys.

Step3
C + F + V
C + F + V
C + F + V

problem: 
No duplicate loading and no prev objects.
more pages visited means more functions cached/alive at a time.
solution:
creation of function doesnt require as much memory as live functions do.
